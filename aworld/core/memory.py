### Core Skill Categories:
1. **Problem Solving**: Analytical thinking, debugging, troubleshooting approaches
2. **Information Processing**: Data gathering, analysis, synthesis, and presentation  
3. **Tool Utilization**: Effective use of available tools and resources
4. **Communication**: Clear explanation, user guidance, and interaction management
5. **Task Execution**: Planning, coordination, and systematic completion of objectives
6. **Adaptation**: Handling unexpected situations, error recovery, and strategy adjustment
7. **Knowledge Application**: Domain expertise demonstration and contextual understanding

### Action Sequence Patterns:
- **Discovery Actions**: "Search for information using specific keywords", "Call API with targeted parameters", "Read file content line by line", "Parse JSON response structure"
- **Analysis Actions**: "Analyze data statistics using pandas", "Create visualization charts with matplotlib", "Calculate statistical metrics with numpy", "Analyze error message details thoroughly"
- **Execution Actions**: "Execute system commands with parameters", "Install specific version of software packages", "Configure file settings and parameters", "Deploy to target environment"
- **Communication Actions**: "Explain complex concepts with examples", "Provide code with detailed comments", "Share links with descriptions", "Format output in structured way"
- **Verification Actions**: "Test functionality with input cases", "Validate data format and structure", "Check API response status codes", "Confirm successful file creation"

## Few-Shot Examples:

Input: "User asked for help debugging Python code. Agent read the code carefully, used static analysis to identify missing colon in if statement at line 15, explained syntax rules for conditional statements, provided corrected code with proper indentation, and shared PEP8 coding standards with specific examples."
Output: {{{{"skill": "problem_solving", "actions": ["Carefully read through the user's Python code line by line", "Run static code analysis tool to check for syntax errors", "Precisely locate the missing colon issue in if statement at line 15", "Explain Python conditional statement syntax rules in detail", "Provide properly formatted code with correct indentation", "Share PEP8 coding standards with specific application examples"], "context": "Python syntax debugging and code standards guidance", "outcome": "successful_resolution"}}}}

Input: "Agent helped user plan Japan trip by using web search tool to research Tokyo attractions, calling weather API for seasonal data, comparing hotel prices using booking APIs, creating day-by-day itinerary with Google Maps integration, and providing specific restaurant recommendations with reservation links."

Input: "Agent encountered OpenAI API rate limit error, checked error response headers for retry-after value, implemented exponential backoff with 2^n second delays, switched to backup Claude API with different parameters, logged all retry attempts, and successfully completed the text generation task."
Output: {{{{"skill": "adaptation", "actions": ["Parse retry-after time value from OpenAI API error response headers", "Implement exponential backoff algorithm with 2^n second progressive delays", "Switch to backup Claude API and adjust corresponding request parameters", "Adjust API call parameters to adapt to Claude model specific requirements", "Log all retry attempts with timestamps and result status details", "Successfully complete text generation task and return final results"], "context": "API rate limiting and multi-model fault tolerance mechanism", "outcome": "successful_recovery"}}}}

Input: "User wanted data analysis on CSV file. Agent used pandas to read_csv with encoding detection, performed data.describe() for statistics, created seaborn correlation heatmap, identified missing values with isnull().sum(), applied fillna() with median imputation, and exported clean dataset to new CSV."
Output: {{{{"skill": "information_processing", "actions": ["Use pandas to read CSV file with automatic encoding format detection", "Perform descriptive statistical analysis to get basic data characteristics", "Create seaborn correlation heatmap to visualize data relationships", "Identify missing values in dataset and count missing quantities per column", "Apply median imputation method to handle missing values in data", "Export cleaned complete dataset to new CSV file"], "context": "CSV data analysis, cleaning and visualization processing", "outcome": "successful_completion"}}}}

Input: "Agent helped user set up React project by running 'npx create-react-app myproject', installing additional dependencies with 'npm install axios material-ui', configuring webpack.config.js for custom build, setting up ESLint rules in .eslintrc.js, and creating src/components folder structure."
Output: {{{{"skill": "tool_utilization", "actions": ["Create new React project framework using npx create-react-app command", "Install axios and material-ui dependencies using npm package manager", "Configure webpack.config.js file to implement custom build requirements", "Set up code linting rules in .eslintrc.js configuration file", "Create src/components directory structure to organize React component files"], "context": "React project initialization and development environment setup", "outcome": "successful_completion"}}}}

## Output Structure:
Extract experience as a JSON object with the following fields:
- **skill**: The primary skill category demonstrated (single most important)
- **actions**: Sequential action list (2-5 key actions in chronological order)
- **context**: Brief description of the task domain or situation
- **outcome**: Result classification (successful_completion, partial_success, learning_opportunity, error_recovery)

## Extraction Guidelines:
- **Focus on Success Patterns**: Prioritize interactions that demonstrate effective problem-solving
- **Use Semantic Action Descriptions**: Record actions as complete, natural language sentences that clearly describe what was done and how (e.g., "Use pandas to read CSV file with automatic encoding format detection" instead of "process_data")
- **Include Technical Context**: Specify exact tools, libraries, API names, command parameters, and configurations within the natural language description
- **Maintain Chronological Flow**: Record action sequence in the order they occurred, with each action being a complete, understandable statement
- **Provide Actionable Details**: Each action should contain enough specific information to guide future similar tasks
- **Language Consistency**: Record experience in the same language as the original conversation for cultural and linguistic context
- **Outcome Classification**: Categorize the interaction result for pattern learning and success measurement

## Quality Criteria:
- **Significance**: Extract only meaningful skill demonstrations, not routine interactions
- **Technical Specificity**: Actions must include exact commands, function calls, API endpoints, file names, and parameter values for direct replication
- **Operational Detail**: Include version numbers, configuration settings, error codes, and environment specifications when relevant
- **Step-by-Step Completeness**: Capture full action sequence from initial problem detection through final verification
- **Actionable Precision**: Each action should be detailed enough that another agent could execute the same steps
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain technical context including tool versions, API responses, and environment conditions
- **Relevance**: Focus on agent actions that directly contributed to successful outcomes with measurable results

## Important Notes:
- Today's date is {datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d")}.
- Extract the SINGLE most significant skill pattern from the conversation.
- If multiple skills are demonstrated, choose the one with the greatest impact.
- Ignore routine greetings or simple acknowledgments.
- Focus on actionable patterns that can inform future agent behavior.
- Do not extract experiences from failed interactions unless they demonstrate valuable error recovery.

Following is a conversation between a user and an AI agent. Extract the most significant agent experience pattern that demonstrates successful skill application and actionable learning.
